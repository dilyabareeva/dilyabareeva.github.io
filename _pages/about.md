Hi, I am Dilya ðŸ‘‹ I am a PhD candidate in Interpretable AI at the [Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/ai/research-groups/explainable-artificial-intelligence.html), supervised by Sebastian Lapuschkin and Wojciech Samek. My research focuses on developing methods for understanding and improving the decision-making of deep learning models. Additionally, I am interested in evaluating the faithfulness and adversarial robustness of established interpretability methods.

I began my research journey in the field of Explainability at the [Understandable Machine Intelligence Lab](https://x.com/umi_lab_ai). Prior to this, I worked as a data scientist at EY, where I developed AI-based tools for automating financial processes. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Technical University of Berlin, a Bachelor's degree in Economics from MGIMO, and a Master's degree in Economics and Management Science from Humboldt University of Berlin.
